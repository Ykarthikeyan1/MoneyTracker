# Money Tracker
I am writing to express my interest in contributing to the MoneyTracker. While I am excited about the opportunity to work on this project, I must admit that I have no experience with React or any other front end,so i used html.

I have a strong background in Django(python),sql, and I am eager to use my skills to contribute to the success of the project. However, I understand that a strong understanding of React is essential for working on the front-end.

I am committed to learning React and becoming a valuable member of the team. I would greatly appreciate any guidance or assistance you could provide as I embark on this learning journey. I am confident that with dedication and hard work, I will be able to master React and make a meaningful contribution to the project.

I am writing to update you on the progress of the money tracker that I have been working on. As you may recall, I was given [time frame] to complete the project.

I have been dedicated to working on the project and have made significant progress, but I have encountered some challenges along the way. Despite my best efforts, I have been unable to complete the project within the given time frame.

I wanted to express my sincere apologies for not meeting the deadline. I am still committed to completing the project, and I am working diligently to do so. I have revised my timeline and now expect to complete the project by [revised date]. I am confident that with continued effort and determination, I will be able to successfully complete the project.

Thank you for your understanding and support. I appreciate your patience and am grateful for the opportunity to work on this project.
Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response
